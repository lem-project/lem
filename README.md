## Vision

Lem brings the distance between code and its execution state as close to zero as possible.  
Users can see the results of their program while editing, without breaking their flow, 
and visually follow the behavior of the running code in real time.

The interface is consistently simple and easy to use without confusion.  
Moreover, Lem is fully customizable, and any extensions take effect immediately as they are written.

### Goals
- Instantly reflect executed code inline
- Visualize running code in real time
- Provide a consistent UI that feels effortless to use
- Maintain documentation for beginners, extension developers, and core developers.
- Offer an intuitive and consistent API for extensions
- Deliver a comfortable environment right out of the box

### Non-goals
- Rather than imitating Emacs or Vim, Lem pursues its own unique approach
