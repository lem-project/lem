;;; Regression tests for `lem-sdl2/drawing::object-height' on the base
;;; `text-object' class.
;;;
;;; Earlier the method returned `(sdl2:surface-height (get-surface ...))',
;;; i.e. the per-string SDL_ttf surface height.  SDL_ttf can return slightly
;;; different surface heights for different strings (notably ones containing
;;; descenders like `p'/`g'/`y' vs ones without), which leaked through to the
;;; background rectangle drawn by `draw-text-glyph-surface' during the `:bg'
;;; phase -- producing an uneven, stepped highlight outline at attribute
;;; boundaries (the "padding around the problem letters" artefact visible on
;;; the dashboard's highlighted row).
;;;
;;; The fix pins the text-object's reported height to the stable cell-row
;;; height (`display-char-height') so adjacent attribute runs paint
;;; rectangles with identical vertical extent.  These tests lock that
;;; behaviour in so a future change to `object-height' cannot silently
;;; regress the visual artefact.
;;;
;;; The tests use a stub `display' that only exposes `display-char-height',
;;; so they run without an SDL window / renderer.  `object-height' on a
;;; text-object does not read the SDL surface -- it goes straight through
;;; `display-char-height' -- which is exactly the invariant we want to
;;; assert.
