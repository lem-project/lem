(in-package :lem/legit)

#|
An interactive interface to Git.

Done:

- status window: current branch, latest commits, unstaged changes, staged changes, untracked files.
- navigation commands
- view changes diff
- stage, unstage files
- inside the diff, stage, unstage hunks
- commit (only a one-line message for now)
- push, pull the remote branch
- branch checkout, branch create&checkout
- view commit at point
- basic Fossil support (current branch, add change, commit)

TODO:

- show renamed files

Ongoing:

- interactive rebase (POC working for Unix)

Nice to have/todo next:

- view log
- redact a proper commit text, not only one line
- other VCS support

Next:

- stage only selected region (more precise than hunks)
- stashes
- many, many more commands, settings and switches
- mouse context menus

- https://github.com/russell/cl-git/ wrapper around libgit2.
- http://shinmera.github.io/legit/ rename that lib and see how useful its caching can be.
