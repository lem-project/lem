;;;; Build the lem-terminal native helper (terminal.so) for the current
;;;; platform from extensions/terminal/terminal.c.
;;;;
;;;; Requires a C compiler and libvterm. On Linux, also requires libutil
;;;; (for forkpty); macOS provides it via libc.
;;;;
;;;; Invoke via `make terminal-lib` or directly:
;;;;   sbcl --script scripts/build-terminal.lisp
;;;;
;;;; The resulting .so is written under
;;;;   extensions/terminal/lib/<os>/<arch>/terminal.so
;;;; which matches the path lem-terminal/ffi.lisp pushes onto
;;;; cffi:*foreign-library-directories*.
