(in-package :lem/legit)

#|
An interactive interface to Git, with preliminary support for other version-control systems (Fossil, Mercurial).

Done:

- status window: current branch, latest commits, unstaged changes, staged changes, untracked files.
- navigation commands
- view changes diff
- stage, unstage files
- inside the diff, stage, unstage hunks
- discard an unstaged file
- commit, redact a commit text in its dedicated buffer
- push, pull the remote branch
- branch checkout, branch create&checkout
- view commit at point
- rebase interactively (see legit-rebase)
- basic Fossil support (current branch, add change, commit)
- basic Mercurial support

Ongoing:

- interactive rebase (POC working for Unix). See more in legit-rebase.lisp

### See also

- https://github.com/fiddlerwoaroof/cl-git native CL, no wrapper around libgit.
- https://github.com/russell/cl-git/ wrapper around libgit2.
- http://shinmera.github.io/legit/ rename that lib and see how useful its caching can be.
