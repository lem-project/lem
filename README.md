After installing lem, you can start developing in Common Lisp at once.

You can skip over writing tidy settings or installing many plugins as you do on Emacs.

Lem supports other programming languages thanks to its built-in LSP
client. You can choose between an Emacs and a Vim mode.

## Requirement
- ncurses
- [roswell](https://github.com/roswell/roswell) (optional)
- SDL2 (optional)

## Platform
- Linux
- MacOS
- [Windows](https://github.com/lem-project/lem/wiki/Windows-Platform)

## Play with Lem in Docker

You can try Lem by running it in a docker container:

```
docker run --rm -ti -v `pwd`:/app 40ants/lem:latest
```

## Installation with roswell

Please install roswell at first.

[Roswell Installation Guide](https://github.com/roswell/roswell/wiki/Installation)

After that, please follow the steps bellow.

```
1. install lem by roswell
$ ros follow-dependency=t install lem-project/lem

2. add the PATH in the initialization file(such as ~/.bashrc)
export PATH=$PATH:~/.roswell/bin
```

### Updating

```
$ ros update lem
```
note: Perhaps this is not enough.
If you get an error, try updating the submodule.
```
$ cd $(ros -e '(princ (ql:where-is-system :lem))')
$ git submodule update --init --recursive
$ ros follow-dependency=t install lem-project/lem
```

### Usage

```
$ lem <filename.lisp>
```

You can watch the screencast on Youtube.

## Installation with sbcl

Please clone lem to a location where the path to asdf is accessible.

```
$ mkdir $HOME/common-lisp
$ cd $HOME/common-lisp
$ git clone --recursive https://github.com/lem-project/lem.git
```

You can start "lem" using the following command.
```
$ sbcl
* (ql:quickload :lem-ncurses)
* (lem:lem)
```

You can create the executable file of lem using the following command.
```
$ sbcl --eval '(ql:quickload :lem-ncurses)' --load build.lisp
```

## Configuration

Lem loads `~/.lem/init.lisp` when starting up.

You can see an example [here](https://github.com/Fedreg/.lem/blob/master/init.lisp)

fukamachi also published his init files on GitHub.
